## Web GUI Usage

1. Download and unzip the source code.
2. Make sure all packages in both `requirements.txt` and `requirements_web.txt` are installed.
3. Run the `main.py` file in the web directory from the command line and keep it running. From the gcastle folder you can use: `python web/main.py`.
4. This will start a local flask server. To access the GUI, open a browser and go to the address printed in the output of step 4. This is the local IP address on port 5000 (e.g., 192.168.x.x:5000). Here, you need to add `index.html` for now so for the example IP address you need to access `192.168.x.x:5000/index.html`.
5. An initial demonstration on how to use the GUI can be seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NOu2oApBgw&ab_channel=kelizhang
